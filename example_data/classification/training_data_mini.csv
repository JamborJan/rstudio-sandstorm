metal;Finished with my woman cause she couldnt help me with my mind people think Im insane because I am frowning all the time All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy Think Ill lose my mind if I dont find something to pacify Can you help me occupy my brain? Oh yeah I need someone to show me the things in life that I cant find I cant see the things that make true happiness I must be blind Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh
metal;End of passion play crumbling away Im your source of self-destruction Veins that pump with fear its sucking darkest clear Leading on your deaths construction Taste me you will see More is all you need Dedicated to How Im killing you Come crawling faster Obey your master Your life burns faster Obey your master master Master of puppets Im pulling your strings Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams Blinded by me you cant see a thing Just call my name cause
metal;Dark eyes shadows grim They come for me Midnight chimes blackened earth The evils rise Pits of hate open wide Chasm of my dreams Last of chimes monks arrive And take my mind again Waste polluted memories Acid rivers flow Vigil for this lands decay Sounding from below
metal;Wild eyed and tight fisted Im fused to the bone I stand contemplating reacting alone Impaled with betrayal the tourniquet turns Societys creation pole axed out and burnt Long ago when man was King His heart was clean now hes stained class Time has slashed each untouched thing So now hes just a stained class King
metal;No sign of life did flicker In floods of tears she cried All hopes lost it cant be undone Theyre wasted and gone Save me your speeches I know (They blinded us all) What you want? You will take it away from me take it and I know for sure The light she once brought in is gone forevermore
metal;Im sitting here alone in darkness waiting to be free Lonely and forlorn I am crying I long for my time to come death means just life Please let me die in solitude Hate is my only friend pain is my father Torment is delight to me Death is my sanctuary I seek it with pleasure Please let me die in solitude
metal;Were gonna take you back Through the pages of the past Just another lonely boy Oh I could laugh and play And live in any other way Then the devil took my soul The fortune and the fame I knew I was not the same When I know Id never return
metal;Tremble you weaklings cower in fear I am your ruler land sea and air Immense in my girth erect I stand tall I am a nuclear murderer I am Polaris Ready to pounce at the touch of a button My system locked in on military gluttons I rule on land air and sea pass judgement on humanity
metal;Im kneeling in front of the altar Satans cross upon the wall Strange emptiness a crystal ball between two candles Melissa has entered another life Melissa you were mine Melissa you were the light She was a witch Why did they take you away?
metal;On the edge of paradise Tears of woe fall cold as ice Hear my cry Renounce have you thy name Eternal is my pain Eternal is the pain that leads me to the thrones of temptation Eternal is the pain that leads me to the thrones of temptation... (PART II) In the Room of Thrones Instrumental (PART III) A Gathering of Angels Lyrics: Romeo
pop;Its close to midnight and something evils lurking In the dark Under the moonlight you see a sight that almost stops Your heart You try to scream but terror takes the sound before You make it You start to freeze as horror looks you right between The eyes Youre paralyzed Cause this is thriller thriller night And no ones gonna save you from the beast about to Strike You know its thriller thriller night Youre fighting for your life inside a killer Thriller tonight
pop;Yeah-eh-heah You are my fire The one desire Believe when I say I want it that way But we are two worlds apart Cant reach to your heart When you say That I want it that way Tell me why Aint nothin but a heartache Tell me why Aint nothin but a mistake Tell me why I never want to hear you say I want it that way
pop;She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene I said dont mind but what do you mean I am the one Who will dance on the floor in the round She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one Who will dance on the floor in the round
pop;I wanna hold em like they do in Texas plays Fold em let em hit me raise it baby stay with me (I love it) Love Game intuition play the cards with spades to start And after hes been hooked Ill play the one thats on his heart Oh oh oh oh oh oh-oh-e-oh-oh-oh Ill get him hot show him what Ive got Oh oh oh oh oh oh-oh-e-oh-oh-oh Ill get him hot show him what Ive got Cant read my Cant read my No he cant read my poker face (Shes got me like nobody) Cant read my 
pop;If I should stay Ill only be in your way So Ill go but I know Ill Think of you every step of the way And I will always love you I will always love you You my darling you hmmm Bittersweet memories That is all Im taking with me So goodbye Please dont cry
pop;Oh written in the stars A million miles away A message to the mane Oh Seasons come and go But I will never change And Im on my way Lets go Yeah Youre listening now
pop;I threw a wish in the well Dont ask me Ill never tell I looked at you as it fell And now youre in my way I trade my soul for a wish Pennies and dimes for a kiss I wasnt looking for this But now youre in my way Your stare was holding Ripped jeans Skin was showing Hot night
pop;Oh baby baby How was I supposed to know That something wasnt right here Oh baby baby I shouldnt have let you go And now youre out of sight yeah Show me how you want it to be Tell me baby cause need to know now oh because My loneliness is killing me And I I must confess I still believe still believe still believe When Im not with you I lose my mind Give me a sign Hit me baby one more time
pop;I hopped off the plane at L.A.X. with a dream and my cardigan Welcome to the land of fame excess whoa! am I gonna fit in? Jumped in the cab here I am for the first time Look to my right and I see the Hollywood sign This is all so crazy everybody seems so famous My tummys turnin and Im feelin kinda homesick
pop;I used to pride myself on being the other man But now its flipped and I dont want you with no other man Why cant you understand anything Im offering I gave you the world but you just wanted arguing From the time I picked you up until the time I dropped you off again Even if flipped out on me at the mall again Its all his fault again thats what you telling all ya friends I aint pointing no fingers ma I just want to call again
metal;An unforeseen future nestled somewhere in time Unsuspecting victims no warnings no signs Judgment Day the second coming arrives Before you see the light you must die Forgotten children confirm a new faith Avidity and lust controlled by hate The never ending search for your shattered sanity Souls of damnation in their own reality
metal;Were the ship without a storm The cold without the warm Light inside the darkness That it needs yeah Were a laugh without tear The hope without the fear We are coming home Were off to the witch We may never never never come home But the magic that well feel Is worth the lifetime
metal; Works of art painted black Magniloquent bleeding dark Monotonous palate murky spectrum grimly unlimited Food for thought so prolific In contrasting shades forcely fed Abstraction so choking so provocative A canvas to paint to degenerate Dark reflections degeneration A canvas to paint to denigrate Dark reflections of dark foul light
metal;Deaths star on horizon Lightning and rain Black winds and thunder The skyline is in flames Written in the red mist The sign of the one Who rides deaths cold wind And walk disguised among All you vagrant souls Of profane disbeliefs False prophets and deceivers Shall swing from the trees
metal;People are in big confusion they dont like their constitutions everyday they draw conclusions and theyre still prepared for war Some can say whats ineffective some make up themselves attractive build up things they call protective well your life seems quite bizarre
pop;Life is a mystery everyone must stand alone I hear you call my name And it feels like home When you call my name its like a little prayer Im down on my knees I wanna take you there In the midnight hour I can feel your power Just like a prayer you know Ill take you there
pop;Hey hey You you I dont like your girlfriend No way no way I think you need a new one Hey hey You you I could be your girlfriend Hey hey You you I know that you like me No way no way No its not a secret Hey hey You you I want to be your girlfriend
pop;I sit and wait Does an angel contemplate my fate And do they know The places where we go When were grey and old Cause I have been told That salvation lets their wings unfold So when Im lying in my bed Thoughts running through my head And I feel the love is dead Im loving angels instead
pop;Before I lay me down to rest I ask the Lord one small request I know I have all I could need But this prayer is not for me Too many people on this day Dont have a peaceful place to stay Let all fighting cease that your children may see peace Wipe their tears of sorrow away
pop;I dont want to talk About the things weve gone through Though its hurting me Now its history Ive played all my cards And thats what youve done too Nothing more to say No more ace to play The winner takes it all The loser standing small Beside the victory Thats her destiny
