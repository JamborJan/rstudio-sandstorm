I hopped off the plane at L.A.X. with a dream and my cardigan Welcome to the land of fame excess whoa! am I gonna fit in? Jumped in the cab here I am for the first time Look to my right and I see the Hollywood sign This is all so crazy everybody seems so famous My tummys turnin and Im feelin kinda homesick
I used to pride myself on being the other man But now its flipped and I dont want you with no other man Why cant you understand anything Im offering I gave you the world but you just wanted arguing From the time I picked you up until the time I dropped you off again Even if flipped out on me at the mall again Its all his fault again thats what you telling all ya friends I aint pointing no fingers ma I just want to call again
An unforeseen future nestled somewhere in time Unsuspecting victims no warnings no signs Judgment Day the second coming arrives Before you see the light you must die Forgotten children confirm a new faith Avidity and lust controlled by hate The never ending search for your shattered sanity Souls of damnation in their own reality
Were the ship without a storm The cold without the warm Light inside the darkness That it needs yeah Were a laugh without tear The hope without the fear We are coming home Were off to the witch We may never never never come home But the magic that well feel Is worth the lifetime
